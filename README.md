# Guild

Guild ~~is~~ will be a cross-platform operating environment built in Racket. Not an operating system, or a shell, but an operating environment - like an OS, but functionally just a shell atop an existing OS. It's called "Guild" because I was originally going to use GNU Guile, but decided to use Racket at the last moment for cross-platform reasons (i.e. Guile is not on Windows).

> Guild isn't real yet. Don't expect it to be real. If you think it's real, you will be disappointed. But rest assured it will become real soon. And by soon I mean whenever I feel like it.
> I seriously just parked this repository here early...

## Development Plan (not for users)

- [X] Install Racket
- [X] Set up Guild's structure
- [X] Write some Racket code just to test
- [X] Write something that gives the illusion of a real Guild environment
- [ ] Write something resembling a standard library
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Was that it?
- [ ] Come up with more things to add to the plan
