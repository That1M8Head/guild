# Guild

Guild ~~is~~ will be a cross-platform operating environment built in GNU Guile. Not an operating system, or a shell, but an operating environment - like an OS, but functionally just a shell atop an existing OS.

> Guild isn't real yet. Don't expect it to be real. If you think it's real, you will be disappointed. But rest assured it will become real soon. And by soon I mean whenever I feel like it.

> I seriously just parked this repository here early...
